Missing checks if you are missing any patches in your master source code repository.
If for a project the underlying version control is GNUArch it will report any patches
that have been committed and that you do not have applied to your local source tree.

If you use Bazaar missing additionally lists the patches that you have commited locally
but have not yet pushed to the remote location. So pay attention to the output wether
patches are local or remote
